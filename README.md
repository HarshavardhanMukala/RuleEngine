# This Project contains the Implementation of the below rules using the Drool RuleEngine in SpringFramework.

we have gathered the following set of rules which need to be managed by the new system.

1.If the payment is for a physical product, generate a packing slip for shipping.
2.If the payment is for a book, create a duplicate packing slip for the royalty department.
3.If the payment is for a membership, activate that membership.
4.If the payment is an upgrade to a membership, apply the upgrade.
5.If the payment is for a membership or upgrade, e-mail the owner and inform them of the activation/upgrade.
6.If the payment is for the video “Learning to Ski,” add a free “First Aid” video to the packing slip (the result of a court decision in 1997).
7.If the payment is for a physical product or a book, generate a commission payment to the agent. Design a new system which can handle these rules and yet open to extension to new rules
